# Who is qeaml?

I'm qeaml.

Here's a list of things I do:

* Write code (obviously)
* Produce ([Spotify][spt], [SoundCloud #1][sc1], [SoundCloud #2][sc2], [YouTube][yt2])
* Make silly little YouTube videos ([YouTube][yt1])
* Study photography (IRL)

And some other things that don't really matter.

## The code

I've tried most of the fields of programming:

* Websites (see my `fib` repository)
* Games (see `aeon`)
* Discord bots (see `autobot`)
* Libraries (see `all`)
* Minecraft Mods (see `mmic`)
* Programming Languages (see `syzkrash/skol`)
* Language VMs (see `syzkrash/skvm`)

And probably other things as well.
