# Who is qeaml?

I'm qeaml.

Here's a list of things I do:

* Write code (obviously)
* Produce ([Spotify][spt], [SoundCloud #1][sc1], [SoundCloud #2][sc2], [YouTube][yt2])
* Make silly little YouTube videos ([YouTube][yt1])
* Study photography (IRL)

And some other things that don't really matter.

## The code

I've tried most of the fields of programming:

* Websites (private repo so can't link)
* Games (also private)
* [Discord bots](autobot)
* [Libraries](all)
* [Programming Languages](skol)
* [Language VMs](skvm)

And probably other things as well.

## The music

I mainly produce [Uptempo Hardcore][tdh], a rather underground genere of music.
I produce other generes on my secondary SoundCloud and YouTube.
